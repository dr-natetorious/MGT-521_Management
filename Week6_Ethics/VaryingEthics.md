# Varying Cultural Ethics

## How would you deal with conflicting ethics

Mathematically speaking there are only two options taking the intersect or the union of the ethical principals.

Taking the intersect is the easiest to implement as it is the minimum set we all agree to. This might include concepts such as treat your peers with respect, don't fight with the customer, stealing is wrong.

However using the intersect asks both sides to compromise on their ethical views. For example harsh work conditions are acceptable for one party but not the other. They need to either compromise their view or provide compensation to the other party.

Taking is the most complex as it asks us to be accepting of all ethical views all the time. Most scenarios will not find this possible at face value. Instead they need to dig into the principals that make up those views, which are often more abstract and guiding.

In reality few organizations will be at either the maximum or minimum intersect , and they need to find a balance. If an acceptable balance cannot be made then it is likely a sign that the two organizations have different goals. In that case finding a different partnership might be a better route.
