# Foreign Corrupt Protections Act

## How do you ensure employees are not corrupted by foreign powers

Every 6 months or so, my company has a mandatory Business Conduct course. In this course there are typically a few sections on foreign corruption policies.

For instance foreign leaders can never receive anything of monetary value, or reimbursement for costs. Technically buying them a beer at a conference is not permitted (unless its free for everyone).

If we want to give them demo merchandise it needs to be pre-approved by legal team, and then it needs to be donated to the foreign leader's department not them personally.

HR reports that people try to step around this policy by having vendor and consulting firms pay off foreign groups. Though these oddities show up in financial audits resulting in immediate termination of the employees.

While behaving in an ethical manner may result in the loss of an occasional sale, it enables the business to catch the bigger fish. They don't need to worry about bad PR, fines, or being banned from import into certain markets.
