# Social Obligations

## How does your organization address social responsibility

My company not only focuses on socially responsible, it expects it and promotes it continuously. Our founder believes so much in social responsibility, that he is donating his entire fortune to philanthropy efforts (Bill and Malinda Gates foundation).

For every dollar donated the company will match with no limit to the same charity. If we instead donate time, the company will pay 17$/hour to that charity. This effort led to passing the 1 billionth employee donated dollar in 2013.

We also have a few big auctions to raise money, with prizes such as mentoring lessons from executives or opportunities to attending small invite bbq at the cvp's house.

An argument could be made that we should focus more on giving the money back to the share holders, but that would be "weird." Donate! has been the culture even through the 2009 recession and to shift now would feel selfish.

A better argument is that a rising tide raises all ships, and it is therefore beneficial to donated time and money toward helping the community both local and abroad.

## Is there a difference between social responsibility and obligation

The difference between social responsibility and social obligation as: one is blindly throwing money at the problem the other is trying to solve the issue.

For example social obligation might donate money to a poor African city so that they can build a mechanics school. Building the schools helps, however the benefits are not realized. This is because there is no economy in that city to sustain the trade afterward.

Being social responsibility means identifying all the vectors of the problem and releave some strategic parts. If that school is to be successful they also need to have more vehicles in the area. This requires additional infrastructure, loans and banking systems, which then needs more high paying jobs, which requires more educational programs, etc.

Being socially responsible is a much larger investment, in time and money. These are commodities than mid sized businesses have less of and smaller businesses have near none of.

It stands to reason that small businesses need to be socially obligated, otherwise they are wasting resources they don't have on scenarios that are not properly allocated in the first place. As the organization grows, so does their available resources; which means they are able to make investments and need to do it in a socially responsible manner.

## Can corporate and personal values differ

Some people would describe it as "selling out" but being able to isolate corporate and personal values is part of being an adult and working in the business world.

At that advertising agency your responsibility is to provide a service to the customer that is exceptional and complete. That is what they pay you for and that is why you've worked so hard for so long.

The cigarette company is not violating any laws, and has just as much right to exist as the next organization. As we start down the slippery slope of cherry picking soon we will be unethical through discrimination in our actions.

## How do you ensure ethical actions align with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Every 6 months or so, my company has a mandatory Business Conduct course. In this course there are typically a few sections on foreign corruption policies.

For instance foreign leaders can never receive anything of monetary value, or reimbursement for costs. Technically buying them a beer at a conference is not permitted (unless its free for everyone).

If we want to give them demo merchandise it needs to be pre-approved by legal team, and then it needs to be donated to the foreign leader's department not them personally.

HR reports that people try to step around this policy by having vendor and consulting firms pay off foreign groups. Though these oddities show up in financial audits resulting in immediate termination of the employees.

While behaving in an ethical manner may result in the loss of an occasional sale, it enables the business to catch the bigger fish. They don't need to worry about bad PR, fines, or being banned from import into certain markets.
