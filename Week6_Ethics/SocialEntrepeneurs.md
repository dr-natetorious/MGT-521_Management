# Social Responsibility and Business Entrpeneurs

## Can business entrepeneurs succeed as a social entrepeneur

How successful an entrepreneur will become, is not controlled by their desire to make a good business or make a better society. It is controlled by how well they:

- define their mission statement
- realistically set strategic and operational goals
- reduce threats and risks;  offset weaknesses

These are general principals that can be applied to any organization. For instance the individual might want to reduce skin cancer.

The business entrepreneur (BE) might design and market a topical cream, and sell it for a premium. Conversely the social entrepreneur (SE) might create awareness programs or fund raise medical donations and assistance.

Consider if the BE had profits of 100,000$; and the SE raised donations at 10,000$. Which one was more successful? It would not be possible to say without understanding the goals of the organization

A core lesson of this course has been that success is not randomly achieved. It needs to first be defined, measured, and then compensated through control functions.

These principals hold true for all organizations irrespective of their intent. The Management text book has given so many examples from so many different industries and business sizes; specially to demonstrate the universality of management.
