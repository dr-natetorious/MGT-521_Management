# Week 1: Management Functions and Other Work

The four functions of management model has been criticized as being irrelevant to today's managers. Do you agree or disagree with the critics who question the relevance of this model? Explain your answer and support your position.

## How would you handle the team falling behind

> ...she is probably inclined to roll up her sleeves and help them catch up.  And this may be necessary.   But her first priority as a manager is to determine why or how the team fell behind, assess the damages and likelihood of the same thing happening again, and seek solutions to her findings.

This is interesting comment, that contradicts a common view from previous customer relations and sales positions (aka time driven work). When I worked in these roles and the business would become rushed with customers, it was easy to become frustrated with the management for not being there.

"They are another member of this company, they know how to do this job; why are they not right beside us helping out?" is a view that others also shared with me.

While that view is easy to have, it is not complete. If the management jumped in to help all the time, when would they have time to improve the configuration? Planning and change would be delayed, extending the broken state longer.

It makes sense that a little sacrifice to plan and organize now, is worth the hassle over the longer haul.

## How do you approach delegation versus doing

Yesterday, I asked my manager what his views were toward this task delegation topic. He said that in order to be successful a manager needs to understand delegation for two reasons:

- Scope and influence
- Daily tasks are often too complex

A good lead needs to direct their team to align with goals that may not be obvious from down in the trenches, but from the company wide perspective 6+ months down the line are. This requires a lot of time and effort to plan and organize. If the lead does not do this, there team might not align with the larger vision and the product suite might be delayed or incomplete.  

Many professional jobs require the individual contributor to spend 1-3 months learning the area, before they can become productive. Assuming a manager has 5-10 people, it is unlikely they could stay current at the implementation level of their team. Instead they only have capacity to focus on the broader architecture and general design.

## Are too many levels of management inefficient

> In my experience, most managers below senior management level, do not have the luxury of spending all their time planning, organizing, controlling, and leading. While they perform all these functions, they have direct responsibility for completing work. In other words, they wear multiple hats. Do you think this might be a reason some feel the 4 functions are irrelevant? Would they be an incomplete description of the daily responsibilities for a large percentage of managers? I also know the title "Manager" is often given to employees who are managing a process or project -- not people. Could this add to irrelevant idea?

At my company we used to have that ambiguity, but our new CEO changed that very early on. Now our company policy states that there can never be more than 7 levels of management and ideally there should be 5.

When this policy went into effect many senior level managers were converted into individual contributors, and predominately only principal managers retained the title and position of leadership. Because of this our managers ONLY do planning, organizing, controlling and leading.

For many of our senior ex-managers, being tasked to only wear the IC hat was a huge culture shock, maybe 1:6 to 1:5 left the company. That career path had ended, and actually implementation requires a different set of skills.

For us cogs in the wheel it has been a great opportunity as there was more transparency through the ranks. We also get the ability to directly lead v-team efforts, which enables more credit even if its at the cost of more responsibility.
