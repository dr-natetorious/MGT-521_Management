# Sustainability

> Sustainability has become a major issue for managers as consumer demand for more Earth-friendly practices continues to grow. What factors should a manager in your business consider as he or she worked to transition the practices within the business to become more sustainable? How would this change that manager's job?

In order to transition a business unit from one state to another, rarely happens instantly. It more commonly happens in stages: Form, Storm, and Norm.

Form. First the group needs to be identify where improvements can be made and then balance the pros/cons of each proposed work item. During this period the manager job is to kick off the team, organize the direction, and lead the prioritization of recommended work.

Storm. Next the plan is set in motion and the changes start to take place. During the transition phase the managers job shifts to over seeing communication, coordinating time lines, and flexing the political muscles to smooth over distrubances to the status quo.

Norm. Once the plan has been implemented, the managers role becomes a final gate quality gate keeper. They assign a direct to handle the day to day work, and typically step in when needed.

Let's use a concrete example, replacing the server closet with cloud computing. Great example of increasing sustainability by removing these power hungry inefficient machines.

In the beginning my manager's job centered around building the plan, organizing teams for the migration, and communicating expectations. Some of the key factors at this point were financial limitations, political resistance, legal requirements, and inertia toward change.

Once the plan was agree upon my manager then had to sell it to the stake holders. At this point his role required more marketing than other tools. After an iteration or two on the plan, budget and time lines were agreed upon.

The work was set in motion and now my managers job focused on broader communication, smoothing over any frustration from partners, and stepping in when SLAs became impacted by the migration. These factors might be clustered into operational management.

After the migration was complete, my manager's job transitioned to wrapping everything up. Getting documentation updated, prescribing guidance and best practices, and getting monitoring and alerting setup. He did not directly do any of these tasks as his role became more project management and validating the tasks were completed to satisfactory.
