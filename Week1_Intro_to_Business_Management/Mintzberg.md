# Mintzberg's Findings

Chapter 1 of Management describes Mintzberg's 1973 findings regarding the roles of managers, defining them as interpersonal, informational, or decisional. Which of these roles is the most critical to a manager in your current situation or workplace? Why?

## What are his findings

Mintzberg buckets the roles of management into: interpersonal, informational and decision categories. Of these the most critical to a manager in my immediate team would be the decision role, specifically disturbance handler and negotiator.

My manager inherited a fragile logging infrastructure used by 500 engineers to monitor a production service. The fragileness comes from running at 100% capacity all the time. To replace the system would be too expensive, and there is limited technical changes that can be put in place.

Instead he is getting the other leads to negotiations per team quotas, and making it easy to identify who is overusing there share of the channel.

Quotas are only one part of the puzzle he is also handling the disturbance from new published guidance and disabling verbose logs by default. These are hugely political issues that many engineering managers feel very strongly about.

## Expanding on this idea

After thinking about this more, the best hat to wear is the one that is most needed for the task at hand. With the previously discussed project a manager in the decision role was most needed. In our latest fire drill it is the informational hat.

Wednesday we received a corporate mandate to use new technology blah, and it needed to be in production by 9/15. This came from our Enterprise VP (EVP), which raised a bunch of questions. We read the 20 page memo which described the company wide vision, but said nothing of implementation level requirements.

Since the scope was unknown, my manager tasked a senior engineer and myself to build a 1-page bulleted list of tasks to completely swap out old technology with this new technology. Beside each time put a t-shirt size of how difficult it would be to do the work.

In parallel he scheduled meeting with our M2's (manager of manager) and M3s to understand the scope they agreed to. We converged our efforts and he presented to his manager the costs versus rewards. They agreed on a plan and pushed it back down to the other engineer and myself. This cycle repeated entirely 3x in 5 business days, due to the aggressive time line.

Without a manager filling this informational role this project would have been a train wreck. It would have been unlikely that we would have time to learn the technology, change the production architecture, and also coordinate with multiple levels of management in such a short time.
