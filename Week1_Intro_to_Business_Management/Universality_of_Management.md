# Universality of Management

> How can the idea of the universality of management benefit you in your current job or position? How can it help you prepare for the job or position you hope to obtain within the next 5 to 10 years?

The universality of management is the idea that management is a universal concept. Anytime you have a group of people together trying to perform a task management concepts come into play quickly. Understanding these concepts will help me be either a better leader or participant.

For example at work the formation of virtual teams (v-teams), is a fairly common practice. Each member of the v-team will come from a different department and be tasked with representing their groups views toward a change.

In these scenarios applying management through planning, organization, accounting of time/resources, will lead to more productive meetings and more efficient outcomes.

When a v-team does well the senior leadership tends to reward the leaders of the group the most, irrespective of who did the hardest work. As these scenarios are fairly common understanding the universality and application of management gives us a competitive advantage over our peers.
