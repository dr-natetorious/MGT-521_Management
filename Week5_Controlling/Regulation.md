## How has the Sarbanes-Oxley Act changed corporate governance

The SOX Act is legislation that addresses transparency to publicly traded companies financial status. It is intended to prevent dishonest behavior and financial record tampering by holding leadership legally accountable for the public record.

The primary benefit is that an investor knows what they are investing in, and there is less ambiguity. Before this law, notorious examples of Enron and WorldCom cooked their books and stole billions of dollars. This has the negative result of reducing investor confidence and therefore reducing the investment into that market.

For businesses to be compliant with this law, management needs to double check their facts, and make sure they do not have misleading information. This leads to more overhead but fewer mistakes and more accurate internal and external reporting.

Through more accurate findings, the management is more likely to make the right calls toward reducing performance gaps. There is also better visibility of status and progress, due to the transparency, which results in improved communication. Improving communication is another crucial component of reducing performance gaps.
