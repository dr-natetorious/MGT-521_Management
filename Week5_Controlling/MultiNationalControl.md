# Multinational Control

## How do control measures need to adjust across different localities

In the "book elephants can't dance," Gestener suggested that the home office defines a series of guiding principals then entrusts lower level management to implement them.

For example home office might ask everyone to dress professionally. The intent is to make the customer feel they are working with a serious individual who will drive handle their project with due diligence.

In America this might be implemented as requiring a 3 piece suit, people of Muslim countries can wear their culture equivalent, and people at the equator or north pole can dress appropriately for the weather.

Later if it turns out that the principals are not being met, then the senior leadership team needs to work with the middle management to discuss the disconnect and decide what corrective behavior is needed.

As we have seen in previous weeks, delegation needs to occur otherwise the span of control becomes shallow and the organizational structure becomes too deep. If the HQ leadership does not trust their regional leadership, then there are bigger problems then what people are wearing to work.

Though perfect trust can still have accidental mistakes, this is why auditing and feedback loops are important. In our example professional dress is asked to ensure customers feel due diligence will be performed.

The company could survey both gained and lost customers to rate their experience between 1 to 5 star questions. Using this information the region can be compared about other regions and identify if there is an issue.

Surprise inspections are also effective ways to collect a snapshot of the regional branch. This provides unbiased data points, but does come at the risk the data point might be unrepresentative of normal day.
