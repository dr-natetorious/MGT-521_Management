# Cultural Diversity

## How can you overcome cultural differences

A former employer of mine had two offices one in Lansing, Michigan the other in Nigeria. Having the Nigerian office greatly reduced costs as those employees were paid 1.25$/hour while those of us in Lansing received 40-60k/year.

However this brought a few cultural challenges that we had to learn to work around. For instance they're facility had minimal infrastructure, there was literally a man on the payroll to walk gas cans from town to the generators. At other times we wouldn't hear from them for several weeks, only to later find there was a civil uprise and no one went outside.

We didn't have the ability to call them and explain what we wanted them to do, all communication happened over Word documents and Yahoo messenger. To further complicate matters they spoke in a broken English; it was frustrating for both ends.

One suggestion from our management was too study Nigerian culture and to search for common slang terms. Then when we started the conversations in the morning ask about the latest Nollywood films. When issues became heated we'd use their terms for describing the mess.

It was these little things that made them feel as though we were trying to understand them. They responded very well to the effort and working together became smoother.

## Does the organization have the right to press their beliefs on the employees

The organization has the right to, _provided_ it aligns with the customs, practices, and beliefs of the location they are doing business.

If they arbitrarily fire someone for their cultural differences, that is can be a form of discrimination. If the company is not careful this will lead to wrongful termination suits and bad public relations.

Consider for example the reactions to Chik-fil-a's CEO saying he was against the gay community. This did not align with the POR and many customers began to boycott the restaurant. People eat with their conscience first, stomach second.

## Is a combative culture ever good

In the book Elephants Can't Dance, Gerstner (former CEO of IBM) described how it the tech industry is the most combative that he had experienced. He said this is due to the unique way that the market is structured.

Typically a market such as clothing outlets or produce will eventually come to a balance between 5 or so major competitors. These competitors share the market and that is that. In contrast the technology market is continuously fighting to have only one company, as being the biggest means they are the standard resulting in even more money.

Since this is the way that the market works, there is benefit for structuring the workers to more efficiently align. I know lots of Amazon people, and they would in general agree that their goal is to be number 1. That requires stopping bad ideas before they can take root, and employees that are confident about their positions.
