# Organizational Behavior and Job Satisfaction

## How would you react if blindsided by a star performer quiting

> The worse feeling as a manager is to be blindsided when someone you thought was perfectly happy gives you their two week notice

From my experience this is fairly common in professional career settings, partially out of fear of retaliation. By telling my manager that I want to work elsewhere; what is their incentive to give me good assignments, rewards, or continue treating me the same?

As managers it is our job to build the trust of the employees through integrity and consistency, so they feel safe telling us that they want to do something different. It is in our own best interest as the loss of the employee is great, but an unexpected loss is even greater.

A former mentor said that he approached this problem by mandating that everyone in his group had to do an informational interview at least once a year. This solved the following problems:

- Employees felt comfortable discussion career goals, even if they didn't align with the immediate team
- Employees felt comfortable announcing they were leaving, well in advance
- Employees that stayed did so because they evaluated the market and actively chose to be here

## What challenges can exist between balancing job satisfaction and business deliverables

Annually my company sends out the "Work Health Index Survey" which collects sentiment on these and similar topics. The results are then aggregated at every level of the organization and then managers are accountable for the received score. Recently the WHI caused my skip manager (M2) to be demoted after receiving a 40% approval.

It was Steve's first year with our company, having come from Amazon. The first challenge he hit was engineering culture differences between his views and the other M2 teams. This lead to reduced communicate at the M2 level, which by proxy resulted in reduced communication of his team and the other parts of the product group.

Next he inherited a large amount of debt and was asked to move a mountain in a short period of time. He focused on the task and less on the moral, which caused his 40 person group to become burned out and their efforts were not appreciated. This came from the message that its still not good enough and we needed to work faster. Most of us worked 5.5 to 6 days a week.

The challenge was that he was correct, we did need to get this done faster. The success of the other 450 engineers depended on our part being better. However better communicating of the urgency would have helped. We knew it was important but why hadn't been properly explained until much later.

He also should have done a better job of managing up that the time lines were not realistic given the number of resources. If a 2 year project needs to be done in 6 months simply running 40 people at 100% is efficient but not effective.

Steve was stuck between his boss asking they go faster, and his skip directs saying slow down. Perhaps the more accurate statement would be, the WHI just confirmed that neither side was happy.

I thought he was a good manager, he had deep technical knowledge and a good vision. After the WHI he created a working group to see if there were areas to improve. No one had any complaints about him personally, and a lot of the problems were cultural and organizational.  

The challenge is that my company has reorganized themselves to have few levels of management, this way there is someone that is accountable for every action. It didn't matter that he had 4 managers reporting to him and these 40 were a layer below that.

As we move into higher into management there is more visibility, more accountability, and reduced job security. That's just part of the package if you want to shape billion dollar product lines.

## How will the employees act if they are unsatisfied with the work conditions

If the employees are unsatisfied with the work conditions or way that their organization operates; the employees will eventually quit or reduce performance to a level which requires termination.

When an employee quits, either voluntary or involuntary it costs the organization lots of time and money. Consider the investment to hiring and training that employee. Then apply the loss of productivity and customer satisfaction caused by the unhappy employee and their lack of effort.

To mitigate these risks a manager needs to understand what the impact of their leadership, and then apply a "soft touch" to get the most out of their need to meet the organizations goals.

For instance Alice works at McDonald's and is the best burger flipper in town. Her schedule is irradiate and she doesn't like to work with Betty. The manager can identify that these two conditions result in a loss of job satisfaction.

Through better organization, Alice and Betty can be scheduled during different shifts. Alternatively Alice could be given some compensation such as public acknowledgment or a small increase in pay (transactional leadership). Or Alice could be taught to work with Betty through team building exercises (transformational leadership).
