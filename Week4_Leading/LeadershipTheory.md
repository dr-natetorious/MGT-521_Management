# Leadership Theory

## What is leadership theory

Leadership theory is a relatively new discipline that is roughly 100 years young. In the beginning the focus was on the leader and only what made the leader good. Overtime the focus shifted toward looking at leadership behaviors and then into relationship within the team.

Leadership is a symbiotic relationship between the manager and the employees. Good leaders inspire and direct good employees, this requires the team to be compatible with the management style. For example a leader who micromanages might be very effective with unskilled employees, but unsuccessful with skilled employees.

In addition to being compatible with the team, there are certain traits which make it more probable the person will or will not be a good leader. Close your eyes and think of the best leaders you've worked with; organized, competent, and well spoken are words that come to mind.

There is merit to both models and I think aspects of both are required to describe good leadership.

## What leadership theory is most complementary in the workplace

Of the three early, contingency, and contemporary; the most complementary would be contemporary.

This is because contemporary looks at both the leader as well as the follower and considers group dynamics. I think that understanding the interactions of the group are the most critical component, and trump individual qualities.

The problem with earlier models is that they did not consider this aspect and instead focused on only the leader, resulting in a overly narrow and incomplete view of leadership theory.
