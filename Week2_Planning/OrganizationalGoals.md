# Organizational Goals

> What factors should you consider in determining an organization's goals? How would you decide which strategic and operational plans to use to achieve your goals?

When selecting organizational goals, the first step is to consider what the organization's mission is. For example, Microsoft's mission was "a computer in every household." This makes simplifying the Windows operation system a reasonable operational goal.

Once a goal is selected to contribute toward the companies mission, the next step is to define what are the steps required to get there. These steps will then map to strategic and operational goals needed along the way.

Continuing with Windows example, they needed to reduce costs and build an ecosystem. This required strategic goals of getting Windows everywhere, which was addressed by partnering with various OEMS such as IBM and Dell.

In parallel, they had to set operational goals, such as how the program would be created. Building something as substantial as Windows requires multiple operational challenges to be turned into operational objectives. Hiring the 15,000 highly skilled engineers needed to write the software, or designing the necessary infrastructure to support these parallel coding efforts.
