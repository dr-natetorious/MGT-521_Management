# Organizational Goals

> What factors should you consider in determining an organization's goals? How would you decide which strategic and operational plans to use to achieve your goals?

When selecting organizational goals, the first step is to consider what the organizations mission is. For example Microsoft's mission was "a computer in every household." This makes simplifying the Windows operation system a reasonable operational goal.

Once a goal is selected to contribute to toward the companies mission, the next step is to define what are the steps required to get there. These steps will then map to strategic and operational goals required along the way.

Continuing with Windows example, they needed to reduce costs and build an ecosystem. This required strategic goals of getting Windows everywhere, which was addressed by partnering with various OEMS such as IBM and Dell.

In parallel they had to set operational goals, such as what how the program would be created. Building something as large as Windows requires multiple operational challenges be turned into operational goals. For example hiring the 15,000 highly skilled engineers needed to write the software, or designing the infrastructure needed to support these parallel coding efforts.
