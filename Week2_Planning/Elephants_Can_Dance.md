## Apply the lessons to business strategy

From 1992 to 1993, IBM's stock had dropped in value to 11$ and the company was losing hundreds of millions every quarter. Their company was centered around the mainframe server, which was over priced and loosing market share to the client/server.

During Gerstner's (new CEO) first months he performed a SWOT analysis in order to select short term operational and longer term strategic goals.

- Strengths: Lots of talented employees, enormous scale
- Weakness: Toxic corporate culture, no standardization, out of touch with customer
- Opportunity: CIOs still saw value in mainframe, only company capable of being the "integrator company" 
- Threats: Lots of competitors

He addressed the toxic culture by killing off the "Management Counsil" a private club that delegated all decisions. In its place decentralized anywhere that it made sense.

Each business unit was its own "independent company" with its own HR, finance, and marketing teams. He kick started hundreds of re-engineering efforts and over 5 years consolidated these management functions.

The world wanted IBM to break up into smaller companies, so that the strong could fend for themselves. He believed that their strategic nitch was being so large that they could be the "solution provider" instead of the "service provider." This would provide opportunities while also increasing the entry bar for competitors.
