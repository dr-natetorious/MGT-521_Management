# Stakeholders

## How do you identify stakeholders

I work on the core logging and analytic system for a large service, which results in a wide array of different stakeholders. Given the limited amount of resources we scope our attention to:

- Senior Leadership, who want usage reports and business intelligence
- Middle Management, who wants self-service scenarios which can be delegated to their teams
- Product Support, who want diagnostic search and troubleshooting
- Engineers, who want their log messages collected and centrally stored

Meeting the needs of each group requires a balancing act, which would not be possible without: planning, organizing, and communication. For example we have been working on an project to reduce our log volume by 30%. This makes it easier for the business intelligence group, but harder for the product support team. 

To address these challenges we asked senior manager to nominate a representative. They join us for a weekly 1 hour meeting, where we lay out the options and collect feedback from the comity. Once a plan is created we ask the representatives to go sell it to their teams.

## Do the unions represent the employees

> Do you think the union and the employees are different stakeholder groups with differing ideas about satisfaction?  Doesn't the union represent employees.

It really depends on the union and how much of a difference exists between the union's real goals and stated goals.

When a union works the way its intended, the results tend toward more "fairness." Everyone doesn't get what they want but they all got the same deal so its psychologically better.

Friends at Boeing having this system, and say that it makes the reward cycle easier and more consistent.

There are also bad unions which leverage the artificial level of organizational management, for their own benefit. They use their power to prevent change in the organization, keep under performers employed, and ensure an unfair distribution of reward.

Friends in public schools and nonprofits encounter this more often, especially when tenure is a component.
