# Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunitites and Goals (SWOT)

## How can you apply SWOT to business planning

When it comes to a building a business plan, its always best to start with identifying the organizations strengths. What gives them the competitive advantage over the competition? Perhaps they hold a portfolio of patents, have a large number of high trained employees, or access to a profitable niche market.

After enumerating the strengths the organization needs to look at the weaknesses that will hold them back. These might be slow manual systems, inexperience in a new market, or insufficient capital to effectively compete. With planning and organization some of these can be mitigated or reduced in severity.

Now that the business has a broad understanding of their long term strategic position, they are ready to look at their shorter term opportunities. For example there could be a new trend emerging, open bidding on a government contract, or business partnerships available.

Lastly they need to limit the large list of possibilities by identifying the threats that are associated with each choice. For instance how many competitors are in the problem space, what is the likelihood that market will collapse, is the entry or exit strategy expensive or cheap. Based on these threats many opportunities will turn out to be dubs not diamonds.

## How can you apply different corporate strategies to different situtations

The three corporate strategies are: growth, sustainability, and renewal.

My workplace is a large high tech corporation, which has been using successful in its growth strategy for about 10 years. They have increased the number of billion dollar businesses but the stock has been flat at around 30$.

Around two years ago we transitioned to a renewal strategy, which started by removing the CEO and several of the CVP/EVP members of the company. Our new leadership team has changed the company mission to align better with the "mobile first, cloud first" era.

In addition updating the words, the entire company has been restructured so there is more consistency across the divisions. The stock has responded by leveling off at 45$ and our adoption rates from customers has been increasing significantly.

## Does a strategy ever need to change

At one point in time the best way to run a dig ditching company was to have more workers in more locations. Think of how much effort it took with their backs and a shovel. Over time the technology advanced and using machinery with less people and less effort resulted in more money.

The same can be seen in other industries such as the automotive and records processing (e.g. health care as you pointed out).

Meanwhile other industries have historically had a difficult time changing their strategies to align with the new technology trends. A famous example being the music industry which refused to embrace streaming music and the mp3 files.

This is why our strategies need to be adaptive with flexibility to adopt contingency factors should the need arise.
