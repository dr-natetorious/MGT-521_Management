# Collaboration

## How can you promote collaboration across the team

I worked on an on-premise product which was merged with a services product. Each of our product groups had very different cultures and viewed process differently. There was also very much of an "us versus them" sense as we generated 1.5b in revenue but and these guys didn't make 20m but got all of the love and attention.

To spark collaboration the leadership team started biweekly friday socials with snacks and drinks. Though simply putting people in the same room is not sufficient. This came from the challenges that cliques already existed and there wasn't an incentive to really interact with our invaders. 

The leadership team said fair enough and swapped 15% of the engineers on one side with an equal number on the other. By introducing the cross pollination our larger team started to act more like a team. Roll forward 2 years and a lot of inner group reorganizations later, our 500 engineers now act as 1 solution team. 

Looking back at it we should have been more receptive upfront, but change leads to uncertainty, uncertainty to fear, and fear to avoidance. The leadership team could improved the merge by participating at these socials or providing more clarity and communication. 

After all if people are worried about become redundant and losing their job or position, sharing more insights and collaboration is likely the last thing on their mind.
