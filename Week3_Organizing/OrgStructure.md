# Organization Structure

## Describe an organically structured business

Google is an example of an organic structure, full of highly skilled employees that are tasked with solving one customer issue every week. To accomplish this they are allowed to barrow, extend, or leverage any asset of the company.

For example if a member of the YouTube group needs code from Gmail, they can freely access it without any red tape. Further if gmail needs to work differently to improve the YouTube experience, YouTube engineers are able to make those changes and donate the code.

This is different from my company where access to different product groups code requires complex approval processes. If we want to make a change there is strict control help by principal engineering managers, who are hesitant to let others write to their code base.

While Google's model allows them to be more agile, there are additional challenges with this model. For example strategic goals might be lost in favor of operational goals. This can lead to short sightedness even if it is focusing on the customers immediate needs.

## Describe a boundary-less organization

The TEALS program is a corporate sponsored nonprofit, with a mission to enable computer science courses in every high school across America. They do this by pairing volunteer high tech professions with high school classrooms. The goal of each school year is to teach enough Java that the students can receive college credit via the AP CS test.

This model naturally lends itself toward being a boundary-less organization. The group has roughly a dozen dedicated staff members, and the other 200 members work for other companies. The volunteers also teach at 160 different schools, where they have the flexibility to make their own lesson plans and put their own touch. 

If the volunteers were instead full time or even paid employees, the economics would be more difficult. Many schools especially in poor areas or rural parts of the country would not have the means for such programs. Also spanning 160 schools requires a decentralized approach. The dozen full time staff could not possibly handle every detail and still grow the program at the same time.
