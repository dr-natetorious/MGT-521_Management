# Team Conflicts

## Given an example of team conflict and why it existed

The challenge with UoPX learning teams comes from its organization structure:

- They are teams not groups; not official leadership
- Boundary less in structure; we're parents, employees, etc. first.. second students
- No clear accountability of tasks or efficiency
- Pure online setting which 'dehumanizes' the peers

For some people this leads to a culture shock as they are asked to either self manage or lead a group of strangers. During this period of leadership, conflict and poor communicate are inevitable.

The options to address those byproducts of the organization structure are limited. Typically these conflicts are addressed through avoidance as 1 or 2 members simply pick up the slack.

From my experience (this being my 40th+); the learning team concept is very valuable as many business situations work this same way. As we continue further into our careers these appear as task forces and virtual teams, all appearing more frequently.

Another observation is that 100/200 level courses function much worst than 300/400 level classes. This same behavior exists in business; as entry level employees do not approach v-teams as well as senior level employees (in general).

## How do you handle team conflicts

In my profession conflicts happen all of the time, this is the natural byproduct of sticking several high skilled employees in a room and asking for one solution. Different approaches are sure to form, many of which are viable and sufficiently address the business requirements.

The first and most important step is to stay calm, collective and listen to the points of the other side. Next it is important to evaluate the view in terms of a cost benefit ratio. Based on this analysis the best parts should be kept and incorporated into our own plan.

A compromise can often be made, assuming egos or political land grabs do not get in the way. Instead business level objectives need to remain the goal.

This is easier said than done if we are new to the group. Being new means that history and context can be missing from the our perspective. These gaps need to be filled in by meeting with the stakeholder and understanding why they feel `<x>` is better than `<y>`.

Conversely if we have been in the group for some time, there is seniority and a track record of results. This history of success tends to gain attention and make peers more willing to listen to the ideas.
