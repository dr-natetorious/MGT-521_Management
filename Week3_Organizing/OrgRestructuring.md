# Organizational Restructuring

## How can reducing layers of management improve quality

In the book "Elephants Can't Dance" the author discusses the internal structure of IBM during the mid 1990s.

One challenge that they had was that many managers "presided over" not "managed over" their departments. They had no insights into their businesses and acted more like a project liaison/dispatcher than any sort of leader.

Gerstner hated the idea of these people as they only obfuscated communication, and didn't provide any measurable results. This provided the basis for downsizing and replacing parts of the management structure.

The net result was clearer communication through the ranks and better accountability of behavior.

## Compare shared leadership to sole ownership

A few years ago my job had leveraged a trio-model, where each area had 3 managers. The idea was that one for development, quality, and project management.

This model was pitched as being a step toward better communication between functional areas. Instead it removed direct accountability for failures in our software design pipeline. Because there was no easy way to hold leadership accountable; quality slipped, broken features were introduced, and it became chaotic. 

We improved the quality by reducing the trio-model leadership down to a single principal manager per area. This made it very easy identify who was responsible or at fault, thus improving quality through visibility.

## What is the correct number of managers

I would agree and also say that it is not the raw size of the organization, but the number of skilled and unskilled workers within the organization.

For example Walmart has 1000s upon 1000s of unskilled employees, combined with a low bar of entry into the organization. Given these two conditions more managers are required to "inspect what they expect"

Comparatively look at a group like Bungee Game, which has two levels of management for the entire business. They have an extremely competitive entry bar and only employee very skilled workers. These workers are assumed to do their work with little oversight.

Consider the complexities of Walmarts (230b) and then compare that to Amazon(245b). Walmart has to invest much more time in overseeing these unskilled employees, while amazon can have smaller work groups of specialized workers and have a comparable market cap.

Another interesting pivot of the data is look at a manager overseeing 1 million dollars worth of labor at both of these companies.

It's a lot easier to only oversee 10 @100k$ employees, than 100 @10k$.

## How does organizational structure need to align with products delivered

I thought that it could be about marketing strategy and pricing. For example at my company we used to align our 500 products as 500 products. 

This meant that it was easy for wall street to ding us for losing money on Surface while not properly understanding the sales strategy of Office. 

To address this during our massive reorg, the first thing to change was winners and losers were merged together. Then only the final aggregate would be reported, allowing per product loss to be hidden in the big picture.

This made marketing the company to stock investors, our financial stakeholder segment, easier and more effective. The stock has since moved from 30 to 45$. 

Yes there were other benefits, such as: larger span of control, better communication between related areas, reduced waste, etc. Perhaps that was only the first step to unblock these later benefits?

## How can restructuring improve the business

One of the challenges for my organization is that they have 130,000 engineers; which enables them to produce a massive amount of results, yet they have poor agility. This has prevented us from taking part in many market trends until the ship has sailed.

To address this we are going through a huge company restructuring, with many elements changing. For example to the world we are one company, but internally we are 10,000 different companies going in 500 different directions.

This is being addressed by merging the disconnected units into large verticals, e.g. consumer products, services, operating systems, and enterprise. With having the business restructured, there will be less redundancy and a more coherent direction for each of the divisions. 

Another area that has changed is the management structure, we have flattened from 8-12 levels down to 5-7. This makes the team's scope of control wider and provides more accountability for quality and results.
